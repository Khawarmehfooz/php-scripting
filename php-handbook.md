# 1. Introduction to PHP

## 1.1 What is PHP?

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source scripting language that is designed for web development. It is embedded within HTML and allows developers to create dynamic web pages. PHP is server-side scripting, meaning that it runs on the webserver and generates HTML that is sent to the client's web browser.

### Example:

```php
<?php
    echo "Hello, World!";
?>

```

In the above code, <?php ... ?> is used to enclose PHP code, and echo is used to output "Hello, World!" to the browser.

## 1.2 Setting Up a PHP Development Environment

To start writing PHP code, you need a development environment. You can set up a PHP development environment by installing a web server (like Apache), a PHP interpreter, and a database (if needed).

### Example:

Install XAMPP for a bundled solution that includes Apache, PHP, MySQL, and more.

## 1.3 Your First PHP Script

Let's create a simple PHP script to display the current date and time.

### Example:

```php
<?php
    // This is a PHP comment
    echo "Current date and time: " . date("Y-m-d H:i:s");
?>
```

In the above code, we use date() to get the current date and time, and echo to display it on the web page.

# 2. Variables and Data Types

In PHP, variables are used to store and manipulate data, and data types define the type of data a variable can hold. Understanding variables and data types is fundamental in PHP programming.

## 2.1 PHP Variables

A variable in PHP is a symbol or name that represents a value. Variable names are case-sensitive and must start with a dollar sign `$`, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. Here's how you declare and assign values to variables:

```php
$variable_name = value;

```

### Example

```php
$name = "John";
$age = 30;
$isStudent = true;
```

In the above code, we've declared three variables: $name, $age, and $isStudent, and assigned values to them.

## 2.2 Data Types in PHP

PHP supports various data types, including:

### 2.2.1 Integer:

Integer data types represent whole numbers, both positive and negative.

```php
$integerVar = 42;
```

### 2.2.2 Float (or Double):

Float data types represent numbers with decimal points.

```php
$floatVar = 3.14159;
```

### 2.2.3 String:

String data types represent sequences of characters.

```php
$stringVar = "Hello, PHP!";
```

### 2.2.4 Boolean:

Boolean data types represent true or false values.

```php
$boolVar = true;
```

### 2.2.5 Array:

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

```php
$colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

### 2.2.6 Null:

Null is a special data type representing the absence of a value.

```php
$nullVar = null;
```

## 2.3 Variable Scope

Variable scope defines where in the code a variable can be accessed or modified. PHP has three main variable scopes:

### 2.3.1 Local Scope:

Variables declared inside a function have local scope and can only be accessed within that function.

```php
function myFunction() {
    $localVar = "I'm local!";
}
```

### 2.3.2 Global Scope:

Variables declared outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the script.

```php
$globalVar = "I'm global!";
```

### 2.3.3 Static Scope:

Variables declared as static within a function retain their values between function calls.

```php
function countCalls() {
    static $count = 0;
    $count++;
    echo "Function has been called $count times.";
}
```
